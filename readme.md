# Modeling the Impact of Public Traffic on COVID-19 Spread Rates in Germany
Forschungspraxis project on traffic network reconstruction in the wake of COVID-19. This repository holds all information related to the Forschungspraxis project offered by LSR.

## Abstract
This report builds on the idea of the networked SEIR model to recover pandemic spread parameters and apply the identified model for simulation/prediction of pandemic activity based on COVID-19 case data, public transport schedule information and estimated mobility behavior of a population. A data-driven methodology to the problems of transient network structure recovery and time-varying strength of adjacency estimation is presented. A case study on German data is implemented and the resulting modelsâ€™ performances are evaluated numerically and graphically.
