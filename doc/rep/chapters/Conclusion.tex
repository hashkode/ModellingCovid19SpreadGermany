\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, the networked SEIR model from \cite{vrabacCapturingEffectsTransportation2020} was applied to German geopolitical, transport and behavior data. The experimental results suggest that mobility induced spreading is an important factor, though community spreading within counties still accounts for the majority of transmission (see \autoref{tbl:seirParametersAndError} and \cite{aravindakshanPreparingFutureCOVID192020}). Counterfactual simulation with a modified behavior vector suggests that reduced long-distance rail-bound mobility played a role in reducing the pandemic spread and could be a measure to contain future outbreaks. Future works building on the approach should consider a) addition of a new compartment for vaccinated cases alongside declined immunity over time \cite{bjornstadSEIRSModelInfectious2020} and b) introduction of novel data sources like policy information, weather data or virus strain characteristics to improve the scaling factors $\psi$ of the adjacency matrices for further improvement of the model's accuracy.
